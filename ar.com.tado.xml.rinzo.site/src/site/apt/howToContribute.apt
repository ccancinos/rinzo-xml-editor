Collaboration

  Until today collaborating to Rinzo was a little bit hard so in order to make it easier, Rinzo's code and bug tracking is now being hosted at {{{http://github.com}GitHub}}.
  Hopefully this will encourage the ones who already contributed patches, and the ones who wanted to but didn't know how, to keep improving this project.
  We really appreciate any feedback or pull-request you might contribute to this project at:
  
  * Bug tracker: {{{https://github.com/ccancinos/rinzo-xml-editor/issues}https://github.com/ccancinos/rinzo-xml-editor/issues}}
  
  * Source code: {{{https://github.com/ccancinos/rinzo-xml-editor.git}https://github.com/ccancinos/rinzo-xml-editor.git}}
  
  And if you are new to git, you might want to take a look at this links:
